/*******************************************************************************
 * CYD ESP32-2432S028 LVGL Claude Code Stub
 *
 * For the "Cheap Yellow Display" ESP32-2432S028 (ILI9341 + XPT2046 touch).
 *
 * A minimal starting point for building an LVGL application from scratch on
 * this hardware.  The UI lives in a tiny ui.h / ui.cpp pair in the sketch
 * folder that draws a simple "Hello, world!" screen.
 *
 * The intent is to hand this to Claude Code (or any developer) as a clean
 * scaffold: the display, touch, and LVGL plumbing is already wired up, so you
 * can focus on writing your own UI in ui.cpp.  Just replace the contents of
 * ui_init() with your own widgets and grow from there.
 *
 * Orientation: lv_setup.begin(rotation) accepts 0 = portrait (240x320, the
 * ILI9341's native orientation), 1 = landscape (320x240), 2 = portrait
 * flipped, 3 = landscape flipped (degrees 90/180/270 work as aliases for
 * 1/2/3).  This sketch defaults to portrait; change the argument below to
 * rotate.  Display and touch rotate together.
 *
 * Demonstrates touchscreen, LVGL and a hand-written UI.
 *
 * Compatible with LVGL 9; the bundled lv_conf.h is based on LVGL 9.3.  If your
 * installed LVGL differs, the API is generally close enough to adapt.
 *
 * Requires the following libraries:
 *   - chipguy_cyd2432S028_display  (display + touch driver, this library)
 *   - lvgl 9
 *
 * Arduino IDE Board Settings:
 *   - Board: "ESP32-2432S028R CYD" (in Tools > Board > esp32) — configures the
 *     board specifics for you; no other settings needed.

// The Montserrat font is built into LVGL in multiple sizes, each size takes up memory.
